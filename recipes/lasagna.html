            more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it 
            would become. One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's 
            Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has 
            ranked among the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for 
            two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years 
            old â€” read all about his life and legacy here. <br>
